# mameblock.js

mameblock.js is very simple Javascript library for visual code editing.

- This is another Block-type code editor other than Scratch / Blockly.
- You can use HTML files of Web page and apps include your own visual code editor.
- Very simple. I wrote just only 100 lines Javascript code with some library.
- Using **jquery-sortable** for nested sortable created by Jonas von Andrian. **jquery-sortable** is another jQuery plugin not jQuery-UI sortable.
